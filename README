This is the README for project 1 of OS Spring 2020.
I took OS last semester and am retaking for a better grade so my project is similar to my project last semester.
Also, I used git. To see my commits, you can type git log into the command. 
I have this linked up to my GITHUB repository

I referenced these sites and the Robbins/Robbins book for help with errno, perror, and stat functions

The format for the date is weird. Even though there is no \n after the date, it prints the path of the file/dir on a
separate line
As mentioned in class, honesty is the best policy. I do not want you too come
across any unexpected seg faults or issues like that. 
./dt to run 
type make to make the program
type make clean to make it clean
