This is the README for project 1 of OS Fall 2019. I had some issues with this project so I will outline them in this README.
Also, I used git. To see my commits, you can type git log into the command. 
I also tried to use GITHUB but there was some strange error that I did not want 
to waste time trying to fix. 
First, getopt works fine but my recursive directory call only prints the information
of the "hidden" files, not of all my files for some reason. I referenced this 
code for the recursive because every time I tried with other algorithms my 
program crashed or the file format would be very hard to read.

That being said, my file format is not correct as there are a bunch of 
letters/number combos that I do not know where they came from and I cannot get rid of them. 
Next, -h,-s, -p, -u, -g, -d, -l options all work. My print function already prints file type. 
The number of linkes SHOULD work but for some reason I keep geting strange numbers.
For information on how to print permissions, I used this website: http://codewiki.wikidot.com/c:system-calls:stat

I have never used stat before so it took me a while to figure out what parameters 
were accepted, what functions were included, formatting, etc. 

As mentioned in class, honesty is the best policy. I do not want you too come 
across any unexpected seg faults or issues like that.
